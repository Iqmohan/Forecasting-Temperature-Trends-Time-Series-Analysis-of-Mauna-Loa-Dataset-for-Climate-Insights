# Forecasting-Temperature-Trends-Time-Series-Analysis-of-Mauna-Loa-Dataset-for-Climate-Insights
It focus on temperature forecasts using time series analysis techniques applied to the Mauna Loa dataset. It indicates your intent to uncover trends and patterns in temperature data, which can provide valuable insights into climate dynamics and long-term climate change. 


Steps Involved :
step 1 - Load the dataset

step 2 getting the shape of the dataset

step 3 - getting the information about the dataset

step 4 - getting the statistical data of the dataset

step 5 - getting the datatype in the dataset

step 6 - finding the missing data

step 7 - plotting the distribution to visualize the outliers

step 8 - now we will see if there are outliers in the data

step 9 - identifying the outliers

step 10 - removing the outliers

step 11 - Feature engineering

step 12 - finding the unique values in the dataset where we have the category of input plotting the distribution of boxplot.

step 13- Indexing Date column

step 14 -Finding the maximum temperature

step 15-data.plot() Graph has seasonality as it is following the pattern,it is uptrend,it has noise also..

step 16 - Seasonal Decomposition

step 17 - Working to make the data stationary.

step 18 - Transformation - rolling mean and log Transformation to make data stationary.

step 19 : Model used - ARIMA and SARIMA

step 20 :Finding optimum p,d,q values

step 21 : Temperature Forecasting
